    <p>We are a collective of engineers, philosophers, sociologists, and idealistic practitioners. We have gathered here for a single, shared purpose: <strong>to rebuild a solid foundation of trust for an increasingly atomized digital world.</strong>
We see that today, as technology advances exponentially, the trust between individuals and organizations is eroding at an equal pace. Algorithmic biases, platform silos, anonymous malice, capital frenzies&hellip; all of these are increasing the collaborative friction of our society and wearing away the bedrock of our civilization.
We firmly believe that the reconstruction of trust cannot rely solely on moral appeals. It must be achieved through <strong>a more advanced, equitable, and transparent institutional design.</strong>
This &ldquo;institution&rdquo; is the Q-Linked protocol.</p>
<p>It is not a commercial platform, but an open-source <strong>&ldquo;Computational Trust&rdquo; protocol</strong> that serves all of society. It aims to transform humanity&rsquo;s most precious quality—<strong>reputation</strong>—from a vague, subjective concept into a computable, verifiable, and portable digital asset.
We have chosen <strong>commerce</strong> as the first proving ground for this protocol because it is the domain where trust is most concentrated and most easily quantified. We intend to first demonstrate that a commercial ecosystem based on &ldquo;reputation sovereignty&rdquo;—rather than &ldquo;platform hegemony&rdquo; or &ldquo;capital hegemony&rdquo;—is not only possible, but also more efficient, more equitable, and more vital.
But our vision extends far beyond that.</p>
<h3 id="our-mission">
  Our Mission

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>To build a decentralized, permissionless trust infrastructure that forges every individual&rsquo;s valuable contributions into an indelible, sovereign part of their digital identity, ultimately empowering a more equitable, collaborative, and creative global digital civilization.</p>
<h3 id="our-vision">
  Our Vision

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>To become the &ldquo;<strong>Meta-Protocol</strong>&rdquo; for trusted collaboration in the future digital society—between people, between people and machines, and even between different civilizations. The world we hope to build is one where it is easier for &ldquo;good people&rdquo; to succeed.
<strong>Our endeavor begins in commerce, matures in society, and culminates in civilization.</strong>
We are Q-Linked. We are here to design a new mathematics for trust.</p>
