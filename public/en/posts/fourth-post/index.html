<p>Before discussing any technical details, we must first clarify our position: <strong>We are a Chinese company serving China&rsquo;s real economy, and all our technical architecture and business models are built with compliance with national laws and regulations as the highest premise.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What We Will Never Touch:</strong> We solemnly promise that the Q-Linked protocol will never involve the issuance or trading of any form of virtual currency. All proofs within the platform (PSD, BDC, UCP) are tools for recording contribution and credit, denominated in RMB, decoupled from any virtual currency throughout their lifecycle, and will never be listed on any secondary market. We are dedicated to solving the trust problem in the real economy, not creating new speculative instruments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What We Actively Embrace:</strong> The technologies we adopt are &ldquo;new infrastructure&rdquo; technologies vigorously advocated and supported by the state. Our core ledger will be built on a <strong>permissioned blockchain</strong> licensed and filed with the state (such as Chang&rsquo;an Chain, FISCO BCOS). We actively seek cooperation with regulatory bodies and have proactively designed and offered a read-only &ldquo;<strong>Regulatory Observer Node</strong>&rdquo; interface. This allows regulatory authorities, with proper authorization, to conduct anonymized observation and risk warning on macroeconomic data, ensuring both business confidentiality and user privacy. We strive to be a responsible and transparent builder in the &ldquo;digital economy.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="second-principle-mature-and-reliable-technology-selection">
  <strong>Second Principle: Mature and Reliable Technology Selection</strong>
  <a class="heading-link" href="#second-principle-mature-and-reliable-technology-selection">

</h3>
<p>Our technology selection follows the principles of &ldquo;sufficient, mature, and open,&rdquo; rather than blindly chasing the latest and flashiest concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Identity (DID) &amp; Verifiable Credentials (VCs):</strong> We fully adhere to <strong>W3C international standards</strong>. This ensures that the identity and credit system we build will have the broadest openness and interoperability for the future, capable of seamlessly connecting with the global digital ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT):</strong> Our choice of a <strong>permissioned blockchain</strong> over a public one is a deliberate strategic decision. The &ldquo;node admission&rdquo; mechanism of a permissioned chain not only satisfies the data immutability characteristic of decentralization but also ensures that all participating nodes are identifiable and their actions traceable. This perfectly aligns with the compliance requirements for high performance, low cost, and, most importantly, being &ldquo;<strong>regulator-friendly</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid Architecture:</strong> We employ a mature &ldquo;<strong>on-ledger + off-ledger</strong>&rdquo; hybrid architecture. Core, consensus-critical data (such as the hash fingerprints of proofs and final credit scores) are recorded on-ledger for transparency and immutability. Meanwhile, specific transaction details, user privacy data, etc., are stored encrypted off-ledger, with access granted only through the user&rsquo;s authorization via their digital identity wallet. This strikes the optimal balance between the &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; required for trust and &ldquo;privacy.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <strong>Third Principle: Progressive Governance with Checks and Balances</strong>

<p>A sustainable digital civilization must have a robust and self-evolving governance structure. Our &ldquo;<strong>Tricameral Governance</strong>&rdquo; model is the technical embodiment of this idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical Implementation:</strong> We will implement governance through a composite set of technical solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Contributors&rsquo; Council (Users)</strong>&rsquo; &ldquo;1 UCP, 1 Vote&rdquo; mechanism will be implemented on-ledger via <strong>smart contracts</strong> to ensure absolute fairness.</li>
<li>The <strong>Merchants&rsquo; Council (Merchants)</strong>&rsquo; &ldquo;credit-weighted voting&rdquo; will have its core algorithm published on-ledger, but the voting process can be conducted efficiently off-ledger, with the results recorded on-ledger as proof.</li>
<li>The <strong>Council of Sages (Guardians)</strong>, as the final arbiter, will have its power exercised through technical interfaces strictly limited to predefined &ldquo;emergency states&rdquo; or &ldquo;constitutional crises&rdquo; in smart contracts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evolutionary Path:</strong> Our governance will follow a prudent path of &ldquo;<strong>progressive decentralization</strong>.&rdquo; In the initial phase of the ecosystem, the platform entity (Q-Linked Genesis) will play a more active role in guidance and cultivation. As the ecosystem matures and the community grows, various powers will be steadily and orderly transferred to community governance bodies driven by UCP and D-MCS, in accordance with the Governance Charter. The ultimate goal is to achieve a mature, self-driving digital civilization that truly belongs to all its co-builders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We are deeply aware that the journey to build trust is long and arduous. But we are equally convinced that with a clear philosophical guide, a fair institutional design, and a solid technical foundation, this path, if walked, will lead to its destination.</p>
